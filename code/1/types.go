	// keys of the Header map are treated as if they were
	// trailers. See the example. The second way, for trailer
	// keys not known to the Handler until after the first Write,

	// headers have been flushed (due to either an explicit Flusher.Flush
	// call or writing enough data to trigger a flush), the request body
	// may be unavailable. For HTTP/2 requests, the Go HTTP server permits
