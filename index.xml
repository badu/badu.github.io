            <description>TL;DR This series is about my questions and thoughts regarding net/http package. The process of
                learning is based on mistakes, therefor I&amp;rsquo;m inviting you to learn aside me.

                ListenAndServe As you might well know, using http package is easy :
                package main import ( &amp;quot;io&amp;quot; &amp;quot;net/http&amp;quot; &amp;quot;log&amp;quot; ) func

                First Glance I have a confession to make : despite the fact that &amp;ldquo;Keep types close&amp;rdquo;
                rule is fair enough, the architect in me needs to reorganize the code in such a manner that a 10000 feet

            <description>TL;DR &amp;ldquo;Java is to Javascript like Car is to Carpet.&amp;rdquo; - Collective Genius
                My Computer Language is Better than Yours Some programming languages were - let&amp;rsquo;s say -
                discovered over time, whereas others were created academically by carefully selecting the features that
                would provide solutions to a set of problems. Thereâ€™s nothing terribly new about spawning programming
                languages. However, haters gonna hate and will always find one, in an office near you or over the
                Internet.

                being on time work ethic effort body language energy attitude passion being coach-able doing extra being
                prepared Before Activemall It was 2015. I was leaving Altfactor because they split and in the process,
                they killed the most interesting project I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked on.
                That project was an awesome second screen smart TV application, that allowed the user to interact with a
                smart TV from a mobile device like a table or phone.

            <title>Working with me</title>
            <link>http://badu.github.io/hire-me/</link>

            <description>Working with Bogdan (Badu) I&amp;rsquo;m wearing many hats, having a non trivial understanding
                of human resources, software development process, risk management, diplomacy and engineering. Nowadays I
                write tools in Go, web applications and automate stuff. I deal with data stores, schedulers, security,
                etc. and I&amp;rsquo;m always looking to improve things.
                For those of you that are trying to relocate me, please understand this is not the case. At least not
                for now.

            <title>Why Recency Bias?</title>
            <link>http://badu.github.io/why-recency-bias/</link>
            <pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>The name of my blog came to me after reading this article. It&amp;rsquo;s defined as &amp;ldquo;Placing
                higher value on recent events than ones that occurred further in the past&amp;rdquo; by the author.
                Looking on Wikipedia, you will not find the recency bias in the cognitive biases list. My best guess is
                because recency bias is related to learning and intelligence.
                Yes, I find myself using the same design patterns over and over again.
