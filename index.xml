      <description>TL;DR &amp;ldquo;Java is to Javascript like Car is to Carpet.&amp;rdquo; - Collective Genius
My Computer Language is Better than Yours Some programming languages were - let&amp;rsquo;s say - discovered over time, whereas others were created academically by carefully selecting the features that would provide solutions to a set of problems.

      <title>Why Recency Bias?</title>

      <description>The name of my blog came to me after reading this article. It&amp;rsquo;s defined as &amp;ldquo;Placing higher value on recent events than ones that occurred further in the past&amp;rdquo; by the author.
Looking on Wikipedia, you will not find the recency bias in the cognitive biases list. My best guess is because recency bias is related to learning and intelligence.
Yes, I find myself using the same design patterns over and over again.</description>
