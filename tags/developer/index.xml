            <description>Working with Bogdan (Badu) I&amp;rsquo;m wearing many hats, having a non trivial understanding
                of human resources, software development process, risk management, diplomacy and engineering. Nowadays I
                write tools in Go, web applications and automate stuff. I deal with data stores, schedulers, security,
                etc. and I&amp;rsquo;m always looking to improve things.
                For those of you that are trying to relocate me, please understand this is not the case. At least not
                for now.
