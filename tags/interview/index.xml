      <description>Foreword There is no such thing as essential interview questions. Despite the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m trying to help you, formulate questions and/or answers, I cannot help you point in the right direction, since each job has specific requirements and each person is unique.
My word of advising is don&amp;rsquo;t jump to conclusions, just because someone didn&amp;rsquo;t answer your question like you expected you to do. And there are people out there - myself included - who are able to explain you a concept without remembering the actual name or the acronym.</description>
