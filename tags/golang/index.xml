      <title>What you can&#39;t do with reflect</title>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s the problem? A while ago, I was working on backend application in which we were trying to increase readability of the code, while defining a standard. In my morning explorations I&amp;rsquo;ve found a technique (sorry, can&amp;rsquo;t remember where : I&amp;rsquo;ll edit this article when I&amp;rsquo;ll remember) that allowed us to use reflection inside a before type handler, thus decoding JSON payloads would be agnostic to controllers.
A typical controller signature looks like this :</description>

      <description>TL;DR While I was mentoring, I encouraged my pupils to break things so they understand how they work. Using reflect package seems easy, but understanding the mechanics is hard. So, this week, following my own advice, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to create my own reflect package. Here is what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.
Playing with Fire Most of the articles on the subject I&amp;rsquo;ve read have (more or less) the following advice : &amp;ldquo;if you find yourself doing this in a real program, stop immediately and seek help.</description>

      <description>Last week, I took the time searching for patterns inside the main packages. Besides a bunch of aha moments, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that some neat tricks can be used to achieve some goals otherwise achievable by applying different techniques.
For instance, let&amp;rsquo;s say you have a pool or a cache. How do you call your cleanup function?
Decisions regarding where to place that call can be made by testing and benchmarking.</description>

      <title>A Radix Story</title>

      <description>A Radix Story Yes, All You Need is Standard &amp;ldquo;net/http&amp;rdquo; There are, out there in the wild, an abundance of routers that a developer can use. In my opinion, one thing that they all share is the lack of separation of concerns. By separation of concerns I mean mixing handlers with routes and conditions, putting on top of that some cool optimized algorithm for looking up a route (or maybe I should say inspecting a string&amp;hellip;).</description>

      <description>TL;DR This series is about my questions and thoughts regarding net/http package. The process of learning is based on mistakes, therefor I&amp;rsquo;m inviting you to learn aside me.

Part 1
ListenAndServe As you might well know, using http package is easy :
package main import ( &amp;quot;io&amp;quot; &amp;quot;net/http&amp;quot; &amp;quot;log&amp;quot; ) func main() { http.HandleFunc(&amp;quot;/hello&amp;quot;, func (w http.</description>

First Glance I have a confession to make : despite the fact that &amp;ldquo;Keep types close&amp;rdquo; rule is fair enough, the architect in me needs to reorganize the code in such a manner that a 10000 feet view to be possible.</description>

      <description>TL;DR &amp;ldquo;Java is to Javascript like Car is to Carpet.&amp;rdquo; - Collective Genius
My Computer Language is Better than Yours Some programming languages were - let&amp;rsquo;s say - discovered over time, whereas others were created academically by carefully selecting the features that would provide solutions to a set of problems. Thereâ€™s nothing terribly new about spawning programming languages. However, haters gonna hate and will always find one, in an office near you or over the Internet.</description>
