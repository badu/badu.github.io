      <description>TL;DR &amp;ldquo;Java is to Javascript like Car is to Carpet.&amp;rdquo; - Collective Genius
My Computer Language is Better than Yours Some programming languages were - let&amp;rsquo;s say - discovered over time, whereas others were created academically by carefully selecting the features that would provide solutions to a set of problems. Thereâ€™s nothing terribly new about spawning programming languages. However, haters gonna hate and will always find one, in an office near you or over the Internet.</description>

      <description>Working with Bogdan (Badu) I&amp;rsquo;m wearing many hats, having a non trivial understanding of human resources, software development process, risk management, diplomacy and engineering. Nowadays I write tools in Go, web applications and automate stuff. I deal with data stores, schedulers, security, etc. and I&amp;rsquo;m always looking to improve things.
For those of you that are trying to relocate me, please understand this is not the case. At least not for now.</description>
