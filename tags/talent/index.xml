      <description>Foreword So, you are my new connected-over-some-network-or-email-or-something recruiter.
What if I tell you that I posses recruiting skills? Understanding programmers and their psychology would be the first measure of a good IT recruiter, right ?
Telling a good programmer from a not-so-good one comes in measuring both his analytical skills and his human qualities.
I can totally understand that you might have no idea about programming skills, nor can we sustain a conversation regarding philosophical concepts about programming.</description>
