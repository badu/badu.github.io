      <title>Interview Questions for Go Developer Position - Part II</title>

      <description>Foreword See part 1.
Q: What will return the following code?
func returnNormal() int { i := 1 defer func() { i++ }() return i } func returnNamed() (i int) { i = 1 defer func() { i++ }() return i } func main() { fmt.Printf(&amp;#34;returnNormal() = %d\n&amp;#34;, returnNormal()) fmt.Printf(&amp;#34;returnNamed() = %d\n&amp;#34;, returnNamed()) } A: returnNormal() = 1 and returnNamed() = 2 [3 points] (why : lazy evaluation)
 Q: What will print the following code?</description>

      <description>Changing perspective Using abstractions is more about what your code can do. Encapsulation is about how we achieve that functionality.
Foreword &amp;ldquo;I was introduced to complex concepts almost immediately&amp;hellip; with examples I&#39;d never use in real life. It confused me, I didn&#39;t understand it, and eventually quit trying to learn Go because I thought I&#39;d never get it&amp;rdquo; - quote from a beginner captured by Mat Ryer
The present writing is about concurrency and use of channels in Go.</description>

      <title>Interview Questions for Go Developer Position</title>

      <description>Foreword There is no such thing as essential interview questions. Despite the fact that I&#39;m trying to help you, formulate questions and/or answers, I cannot help you point in the right direction, since each job has specific requirements and each person is unique.
My word of advising is don&#39;t jump to conclusions, just because someone didn&#39;t answer your question like you expected you to do. And there are people out there - myself included - who are able to explain you a concept without remembering the actual name or the acronym.</description>

      <title>What you can&#39;t do with reflect</title>

      <description>What&#39;s the problem? A while ago, I was working on backend application in which we were trying to increase readability of the code, while defining a standard. In my morning explorations I&#39;ve found a technique (sorry, can&#39;t remember where : I&#39;ll edit this article when I&#39;ll remember) that allowed us to use reflection inside a before type handler, thus decoding JSON payloads would be agnostic to controllers.
A typical controller signature looks like this :</description>

      <description>TL;DR While I was mentoring, I encouraged my pupils to break things so they understand how they work. Using reflect package seems easy, but understanding the mechanics is hard. So, this week, following my own advice, I&#39;ve tried to create my own reflect package. Here is what I&#39;ve learned.
Playing with Fire Most of the articles on the subject I&#39;ve read have (more or less) the following advice : &amp;ldquo;if you find yourself doing this in a real program, stop immediately and seek help.</description>

      <title>Knowing when the world stops</title>

      <description>Last week, I took the time searching for patterns inside the main packages. Besides a bunch of aha moments, I&#39;ve realized that some neat tricks can be used to achieve some goals otherwise achievable by applying different techniques.
For instance, let&#39;s say you have a pool or a cache. How do you call your cleanup function?
Decisions regarding where to place that call can be made by testing and benchmarking. But what if there is another neat way to do so : just before the garbage collection runs, you can mount yourself a function and receive a call on it.</description>

      <description>A Radix Story Yes, All You Need is Standard &amp;ldquo;net/http&amp;rdquo; There are, out there in the wild, an abundance of routers that a developer can use. In my opinion, one thing that they all share is the lack of separation of concerns. By separation of concerns I mean mixing handlers with routes and conditions, putting on top of that some cool optimized algorithm for looking up a route (or maybe I should say inspecting a string&amp;hellip;).</description>

      <description>TL;DR This series is about my questions and thoughts regarding net/http package. The process of learning is based on mistakes, therefor I&#39;m inviting you to learn aside me.

Part 1
ListenAndServe As you might well know, using http package is easy :
package main import ( &amp;#34;io&amp;#34; &amp;#34;net/http&amp;#34; &amp;#34;log&amp;#34; ) func main() { http.HandleFunc(&amp;#34;/hello&amp;#34;, func (w http.</description>

First Glance I have a confession to make : despite the fact that &amp;ldquo;Keep types close&amp;rdquo; rule is fair enough, the architect in me needs to reorganize the code in such a manner that a 10000 feet view to be possible.</description>

      <description>TL;DR &amp;ldquo;Java is to Javascript like Car is to Carpet.&amp;rdquo; - Collective Genius
My Computer Language is Better than Yours Some programming languages were - let&#39;s say - discovered over time, whereas others were created academically by carefully selecting the features that would provide solutions to a set of problems. Thereâ€™s nothing terribly new about spawning programming languages. However, haters gonna hate and will always find one, in an office near you or over the Internet.</description>
