The name of my blog came to me after reading
[this article](https://hackernoon.com/cognitive-biases-in-programming-5e937707c27b). It's defined as "Placing higher value on recent events than ones that occurred further in the past" by the author.

Looking on Wikipedia, you will not find the recency bias in the [cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) list. My best guess is because recency bias is related to learning and intelligence.

Yes, I find myself using the same design patterns over and over again. Why? Because they are patterns : a simple and elegant solution to specific problems. You don't need unusual language features nor amazing tricks to apply a pattern. The most important part is to improve your patterns while using them.

Those who know me can testify that the collection of patterns that I possess, helped them every time they needed to solve a problem in an elegant and simple way. Being asked on how would I solve a specific problem, I'm bringing all the experience that I've gained along the way : years of testing ideas, billions of lines of code read in various languages.

Overall, this blog is meant to describe my journey and my patterns. Maybe will help you, maybe it won't.
