#### Working with Bogdan (Badu)

I'm wearing many hats, having a non trivial understanding of human resources, software development process, risk management, diplomacy and engineering.
Nowadays I write tools in Go, web applications and automate stuff. I deal with data stores, schedulers, security, etc. and I'm always looking to improve things.

For those of you that are trying to relocate me, please understand this is not the case. At least not for now.

#### What I will bring to the table

* Excellent communication and technical skills
* Experience with customer-facing activities
* Experience with software engineering best practices (unit testing, code reviews, design documentation, methodologies)
* The confidence to input into architecture discussions around deployment topologies, scaling, performance and sizing
* Many years of experience on building complex systems

#### What you should bring to the table

* Willing to work with remote consultants
* You should be an agent of change
* The best possible software and hardware available
* Use an Agile like software development methodology
* A competitive package, including flexible hours and unlimited paid holiday

Please feel free to contact me.
