            <description>A Radix Story Yes, All You Need is Standard &amp;ldquo;net/http&amp;rdquo; There are, out there
                in the wild, an abundance of routers that a developer can use. In my opinion, one thing that they all
                share is the lack of separation of concerns. By separation of concerns I mean mixing handlers with
                routes and conditions, putting on top of that some cool optimized algorithm for looking up a route (or
                maybe I should say inspecting a string&amp;hellip;).

            <description>TL;DR This series is about my questions and thoughts regarding net/http package. The process of
                learning is based on mistakes, therefor I&amp;rsquo;m inviting you to learn aside me.

                Part 1
                ListenAndServe As you might well know, using http package is easy :
                package main import ( &amp;quot;io&amp;quot; &amp;quot;net/http&amp;quot; &amp;quot;log&amp;quot; ) func

                First Glance I have a confession to make : despite the fact that &amp;ldquo;Keep types close&amp;rdquo;
                rule is fair enough, the architect in me needs to reorganize the code in such a manner that a 10000 feet

            <description>TL;DR &amp;ldquo;Java is to Javascript like Car is to Carpet.&amp;rdquo; - Collective Genius
                My Computer Language is Better than Yours Some programming languages were - let&amp;rsquo;s say -
                discovered over time, whereas others were created academically by carefully selecting the features that
                would provide solutions to a set of problems. Thereâ€™s nothing terribly new about spawning programming
                languages. However, haters gonna hate and will always find one, in an office near you or over the
                Internet.

                prepared Before Activemall It was 2015. I was leaving Altfactor because they split and in the process,
                they killed the most interesting project I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked on.
                That project was an awesome second screen smart TV application, that allowed the user to interact with a
                smart TV from a mobile device like a table or phone.
